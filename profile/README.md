# 👋 Welcome to AboveSeven

**Clothes are worn 7 times on average. We are AboveSeven.**

At **AboveSeven**, we believe in a smarter, more sustainable future for clothing. Today, up to **70% of garments in the second-hand market go unsold** — we're here to change that.

## 💡 Our Vision

We're building AI-powered tools to **increase the value and visibility of second-hand clothing**, helping physical and online shops:

- 🧠 Classify and sort inventory more effectively
- 🎯 Create new, appealing collections from existing items
- ✍️ Generate high-quality product descriptions that sell
- 📈 Improve turnover rates and reduce textile waste

Our goal is simple: **More clothes sold, less waste created.**

## 🛠️ Powered by Tech & Passion

We're combining our backgrounds in tech, creativity, and sustainability to build tools that make a real difference in circular fashion. Our venture is based in **Malmö/Lund, Sweden** and we're currently in early-stage development.

We're two co-founders building something meaningful from the ground up — one prototype, one insight, and one customer conversation at a time.
